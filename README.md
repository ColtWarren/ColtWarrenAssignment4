# ColtWarrenAssignment4
My Assignment4 for Coders Campus! This Java application processes a master list of 
students enrolled in various courses and generates three separate CSV files, each 
containing students grouped by their course department (COMPSCI, APMTH, STAT). 
The students in each file are sorted by their grades in descending order. This helps 
professors easily access and analyze their class-specific enrollment data.

# Features
- CSV Parsing: Reads comma-separated value CSV file containing student data.
- Course Grouping: Separates students into three groups based on their course department.
- Grade Sorting: Sorts students by grade (descending), with student ID as a tiebreaker.
- File Export: Generates three CSV files (`course1.csv`, `course2.csv`, `course3.csv`) with headers.
